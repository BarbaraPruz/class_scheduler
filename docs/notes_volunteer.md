School open Saturdays, classes for Adults: English and Citizenship

10-15 students every Saturday for Citizensihp
	- English
	- Civics

Scheduling is something that could be improved.

The way it works now: Non-profit agency in NYC helps people fill out applications, then refers Alex, who refers them to the class.

He wants public portal to get people to sign up as students and volunteers without intervention from middle person. 

Let volunteers kind of set own limits. 

Remote classes: Skype, Whatsapp.

Bottleneck is scheduling intermediaries.

Must be free.

Must be some quality control of services offered.

- Prevent anonymity: Log in with facebook account. 
- Reviews of boh instructors and students

Saturday 10-11:30am.

Make it not dependent on specific time/date, and not that physical location. 

NY Cares needs a physical place.

Some people aren't avail Saturday mornings.
