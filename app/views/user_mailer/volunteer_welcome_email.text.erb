Here are the last steps required to become active on our platform:

1. Screening Interview: To ensure a safe and productive environment for our clients, we ask that our volunteers undergo a brief screening interview. This interview requires no preparation and can be done remotely. Feel free to call, text, or email our colleague Jose to schedule. His contact details are below:

jose.gamboa@earthlink.net
(408) 591-6729

At the end of the screening interview, confirm with Jose that he will activate your profile on the site. Once done, you can proceed to Step 2 below.

2. Availabilities: Please enter your availabilities so you appear in clients' search results.  This can be done from the Availabilities menu option.

Once Step 2 is complete, clients will be able to reach out to you for help.

If you have any questions, check out our FAQ page at https://<%= @domain_name %>/faq or contact us at admin@<%= @domain_name %>. Thanks for dedicating your time to clients in need!
