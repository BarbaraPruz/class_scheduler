Welcome to <%= @domain %>, <%= @user.first_name %>
===============================================

You have successfully created a <%= @role %> account on <%= @domain %>. This is the first step in the registration process.

Your username is: <%= @user.email %>. To sign in to the site, just follow this link: https://<%= @url %>. Only do this after your account is activated, per the steps below.

Here are the last steps required to become active on our platform:

1. Screening Interview: To ensure a safe and productive environment for our clients and volunteers, we ask that our volunteers undergo a brief screening interview by video. This interview requires no preparation. Feel free to call, text, or email our Volunteer Support Team to schedule. Their contact details are below:

<%= ENV['SCREENING_EMAIL_ADDRESS'] %>
<%= ENV['SCREENING_PHONE_NUMBER_DISPLAY'] %>

At the end of the screening interview, confirm with the team that they will activate your account. Once done, you can proceed to Step 2 below.

2. Availabilities: Please enter your availabilities so you appear in clients' search results. Once logged in, this can be done from the Availabilities menu option.

Once Step 2 is complete, clients will be able to reach out to you for help.

If you have any questions, check out our FAQ page at https://<%= @domain %>/faq or contact us at volunteer@<%= @domain %>. Thanks for dedicating your time to clients in need!

Yours in service,
