  Here are the last steps required to become active on our platform:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Screening Interview:</b> To ensure a safe and productive environment for our clients, we ask that our
      volunteers undergo a brief screening interview. This interview requires no preparation and can be done
      remotely. Feel free to call, text, or email our colleague Jon to schedule. His contact details are below:
    </p>
    <a href="mailto:<%= ENV['SCREENING_EMAIL_ADDRESS'] %>"><%= ENV['SCREENING_EMAIL_ADDRESS'] %></a><br>
    <a href="tel:<%= ENV['SCREENING_PHONE_NUMBER_ATTRIBUTE'] %>"><%= ENV['SCREENING_PHONE_NUMBER_DISPLAY'] %></a>
    <p>
      At the end of the screening interview, confirm with Jon that he will activate your profile on the site.
      Once done, you can proceed to Step 2 below.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Availabilities:</b> Please enter your availabilities so you appear in clients' search results.
    This can be done from the Availabilities menu option.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Once Step 2 is complete, clients will be able to reach out to you for help.
