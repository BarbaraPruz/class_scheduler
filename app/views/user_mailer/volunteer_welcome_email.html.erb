      <b>Screening Interview:</b> To ensure a safe and productive environment for our clients, we ask that our
      volunteers undergo a brief screening interview. This interview requires no preparation and can be done
      remotely. Feel free to call, text, or email our colleague Jose to schedule. His contact details are below:
